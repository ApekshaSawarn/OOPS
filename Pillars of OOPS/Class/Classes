Difference between structure and class in C++?
In C++, a structure works the same way as a class, except for just two small differences. The most important of them is hiding implementation details. A structure will by
default not hide its implementation details from whoever uses it in code, while a class by default hides all its implementation details and will therefore by default prevent
the programmer from accessing them.
